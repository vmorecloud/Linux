🐧 Linux Kernel 6.19 Has Been Released!

The latest Linux kernel brings major upgrades in security, networking, filesystems, and hardware support. Highlights include faster TCP performance, stronger protection against side-channel attacks, improved virtualization features, and better filesystem handling.

Linus Torvalds also confirmed that the next kernel version will be Linux 7.0, simply as a version reset—not a new development phase.

Linux kernel 6.19 is available now from kernel.org, with distro updates coming soon.
